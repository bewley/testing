I see wokeness as a modern form of moral self-righteousness—more about appearances than real change. 
Every society has people who gain status by strictly enforcing rules, and today, those rules center on social justice.

Wokeness, as we know it, began as political correctness in the late 1980s, emerging from 1960s radicals who became professors and institutionalized their ideas in universities. 
It faded in the late 1990s but re-emerged with greater intensity in the 2010s, driven by social media, bureaucratic expansion in universities, and increasingly polarized journalism. 
Unlike the first wave, which was largely grassroots, the second wave had professional enforcers—DEI administrators, HR departments, and online cancel mobs.

I don’t oppose wokeness because it addresses social justice—racism and sexism are real problems—but because it does so in a shallow, punitive, and performative way. 
Instead of actually helping marginalized people, it focuses on enforcing a complex and ever-changing set of linguistic and behavioral rules. 
It operates like a religion, with its own heresies, purity tests, and inquisitors, and I believe the best way to counter it is to treat it like a religion—allow people to believe what they want, but don’t let them impose their beliefs on others through institutional power.

Many of those who participated in the worst excesses of wokeness will likely forget or deny their involvement, not out of dishonesty, but because mob behavior distorts individual identity. 
People assume they’ve always thought the way they do now, especially as social attitudes shift. 
The mass outrage cycles of the 2010s, such as the backlash against figures like JK Rowling, will one day be difficult to attribute to individuals, even though they once seemed all-consuming.

I also worry about future outbreaks of similar moralist movements. 
The fundamental problem isn’t just wokeness; it’s the human tendency to create new forms of ideological orthodoxy. 
To prevent this from happening again, we need to resist defining new heresies and defend free speech as a fundamental principle. 
The number of true things we can’t say should never increase. 
If it does, something is wrong.
